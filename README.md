# CP-ALS-QR
This repository contains MATLAB codes for CP Rounding that use QR decomposition for solving the Alternating Least Squares. 

This code accompanies the paper by **Alex Zhang, Bhisham Dev Verma, Jan Van Lent and Grey Ballard. "Efficient CP Rounding using Alternating Least Squares With QR Decomposition". Submitted, 2025.**

**Description:** 
The 'algorithms' directory contains the core algorithms presented in the paper. The 'wrapper' directory includes supporting functions used by these algorithms and fucntions to generate the sinsum of data.
