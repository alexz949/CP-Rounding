# CP-ALS-QR
This repository contains MATLAB codes for CP Rounding that use QR decomposition for solving the Alternating Least Squares. 

This code accompanies the paper by **Alex Zhang, Bhisham Dev Verma, Jan Van Lent and Grey Ballard. "Efficient CP Rounding using Alternating Least Squares With QR Decomposition". Submitted, 2025.**

**Description:** 
The 'algorithms' directory contains the core algorithms presented in the paper. The 'experimental results' directory contains  the code to generate the figures used in the paper. The 'wrapper' directory includes supporting functions used by  algorithms and functions to generate the sinsum data.

# Toolbox requirements
This code requires a tensor package for MATLAB, Tensor Toolbox.
